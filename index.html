            <h3>A multi-objective optimization Method of Initial Virtual Machine Fault-Tolerant Placement For Star Topological Data
                Centers of Cloud Systems (NOTE: The project has been published in UTS By Bharath University)</h3>
            <p>• The objective of this project is to develop a multi-objective optimization method for the initial placement of virtual
                machines (VMs) in star topological data centers within cloud computing systems. The primary goal is to enhance fault
                tolerance while considering other important factors.
                • Star topological data centers are common in cloud systems, but they are susceptible to single points of failure.
                Therefore, optimizing the initial placement of VMs is critical for improving fault tolerance and overall system
                reliability.</p>
            <h3>Smart ATM Pin Recovery</h3>
            <p>• Offer users an easy and user-friendly method to recover their ATM PINs without the need to visit a physical bank
                branch or endure a lengthy and cumbersome process.
                • The system prompts the user to provide additional verification details, such as account number, social security number,
                or answers to security questions to ensure that the requestor is the legitimate account holder.</p>
            <h3>Claims Management System Enhancement</h3>
            <p>• Led the redesign and implementation of the company's claims management platform, enhancing user experience
                through improved API integration, resulting in a 20% increase in processing efficiency.</p>
            <h3>Automated Deployment Pipeline</h3>
            <p>• Developed and implemented an automated deployment pipeline using GitHub and TFS, reducing deployment time by
                30% and minimizing errors during production releases.</p>
